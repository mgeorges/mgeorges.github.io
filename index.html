          <h3>More About Me</h3>
          <p>I am a motivated and enthusiastic well-rounded individual with a can-do attitude, a passion for programming, and a knack for breaking down and solving problems. As a graduate from a top liberal arts university, with a major Computer Science and a minor in History, I have acquired a diverse set of critical-thinking, and analytical problem-solving skills. With my balance of technical and non-technical skills and depth of conceptual knowledge I am confident that I can accomplish any task and solve any problem I am faced with.</p>
          <p>Whether it be through enhancing my current knowledge and skills, or trying out something entirely new, I am dedicated to learning something new everyday. I'm the type of guy who will try anything once. Check out my <a href="#interests">interests</a> to get a better idea for the things I enjoy doing and a bucket list of some stuff I hope to accomplish.</p>
